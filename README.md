## Project Description 
This application processes MoMo SMS messages provided in the XML format. The sytsem extracts, cleans, categorizes and stores data transactions in a relational database. This application will help users understand their mobile money activity. 


## System Architecture
The high level system architecture illustrates how data flows from MoMo SMS XML files through a backend ETL pipeline into a database and finally to a frontend dashboard for visualization.

## Database Design
The MoMo SMS database manages mobile money transcations with a relational design. It includes users, transactions categories, transctions, tags, transction-tags, and system logs. Users and transactions are linked via foreign keys, categories classify transaction types, and tags allow flexible labeling. Constrints enforce valid formats, positive amounts, and controlled statuses, while indexes improve query performance. System logs ensure auditability, making the design robust, consistent, and traceable.

## Project Status
## Phase 1: Planning & Setup (done)
- Repository created and collaborators added
- Architecture diagram designed
- Scrum board initialized 

## Phase 2: Database design, ERD diagram and JSON file(current)
- Draw an ERD diagram 
- Create a database design and SQL tables
- Edit the JSON file

in coming phases we will focus on backend development, data processing, and frontend components. The directory structure will evolve as development progresses.
